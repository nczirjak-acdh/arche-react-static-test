UTF-8 stands for the Unicode Transformation Format, which uses one byte (8 bits) for encoding. This means that each character is expressed with a unique number of 8 bits in length, so that software can support different languages and their writing systems without conflicts. Other UTF-encodings like UTF-16 or UTF-32 use more than one byte per character and they can be stored with the most significant byte in first (big-endian) or last place (little-endian). Thus, a Byte Order Mark (BOM) is needed, which is represented by the non-character U+FEFF. Since UTF-8 is byte oriented, a BOM is not necessary and should be avoided. An advantage in using UTF-8 is that the first 128 characters of ASCII are preserved and encoded in the same manner.

While many open-source solutions could provide customisation and extensibility, they also came with opaque, complex components, which could presumably lead to similar frustrations that we experienced with Fedora 4, which we wanted to avoid.",
